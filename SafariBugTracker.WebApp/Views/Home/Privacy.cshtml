                    Welcome to the Safari Bug Tracker demo. Please read the following as it may impact your experience.
                    During your use of the demo application, I ask that you DO NOT:
                    <br />

                    <ol style="font-family:'Roboto Light', sans-serif !important;">
                        <li>Use this site for any commercial purpose, or for any purpose that is fraudulent or otherwise may violate any Canadian laws, rules, or regulations</li>
                        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the operation of this site, or the systems, servers, and networks used by the site</li>
                        <li>Compromise the site, its contents, or the safety of its users by way of any virus, worm, trojan horse, spyware, or other computer code. This includes using uploading files that are potentially harmful or invasive or intended to damage or hijack the operation of, or to monitor the use of this site, or its users.</li>
                        <li>Harvest or collect information about users</li>
                        <li>Use any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application or other manual or automatic device to retrieve, index, “scrape,” “data mine” or otherwise gather any materials or reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of this site without my express prior written consent.</li>
                        <li>Cause injury to any person or entity using this demo, its code, or any data stored/gathered from within</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h5 class="underline privacy-heading">Personal Identifiable Information</h5>
                <p class="privacy-text">
                    At no time will any personally identifiable information be collected. In fact, I ask that you please reframe from entering any personal information when registering an account, or when submitting issues during the demo.
                    Please note that, should you create an account, you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username, and password. I’m not responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your account.
                </p>

                <h5 class="underline privacy-heading">Web browser cookies</h5>
                <p class="privacy-text">
                    This website uses cookies for account management purposes. Please note that your web browser can places cookies on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
                    You may also choose to set your web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you choose to disable cookies, then some parts of
                    the site may no longer be accessible.
                </p>

                <h5 class="underline privacy-heading">How we protect your information</h5>
                <p class="privacy-text">
                    Care has been taken to ensure the safety of any information entered during the demo will be kept safe and secure.
                    All data stored on the database is encrypted with AES-256 bit encryption, and all communications between the web
                    application, APIs and the database occurs over https. Additionally, all usernames, passwords, connections strings,
                    and login credentials have been removed from the publicly available repository. So any data through the demo will
                    be inaccessible to anyone except the application administrator.
                </p>

                <h5 class="underline privacy-heading">Sharing your personal information</h5>
                <p class="privacy-text">
                    Any information gathered from the use of this demo will be kept strictly private.
                    I will never share any information with any third parties, or individuals. This is
                    demo web application, not a business, so I have no interest in collecting, or profiting
                    from any user data.
